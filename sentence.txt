A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
Do not be too proud of your wealth
Do not count your chickens before they hatch
Do not cross the bridge till you come to it
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs
You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar
